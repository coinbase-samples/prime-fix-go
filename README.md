# Go FIX Client for Coinbase Prime

## Introduction
This repository contains a lightweight Go-based FIX client that connects to Coinbase Primeâ€™s FIX gateway via stunnel. It provides an interactive REPL to:
- Create new orders
- Look up existing orders (using a local `orders.json` cache)
- Cancel orders

Under the hood, [QuickFIX/Go](https://github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix) is used to handle FIX message encoding/decoding and session management, while stunnel establishes a secure TLS tunnel to Prime.

## Prerequisites
- **Go 1.20+** installed (https://golang.org/dl/)
- A valid **Coinbase Prime service account certificate** (PEM format) with private key
- A CA certificate bundle (e.g., `system-roots.pem`) to validate the TLS connection

---

## 1. Configure `fix.cfg` for Native TLS

Coinbase Prime FIX supports **native TLS**, so no stunnel or proxy is required.

To generate a local CA certificate bundle from your system trust store, run:

```bash
security find-certificate -a -p /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain > ~/system-roots.pem
```

Edit or create the `fix.cfg` file at the project root. Replace the `SenderCompID` with your actual service account ID, and adjust the path to your CA file:

```
SSLCAFile=/Users/yourname/system-roots.pem
SenderCompID=YOUR_SVC_ACCOUNT_ID
```
This configuration enables QuickFIX/Go to connect directly over TLS without relying on external proxies like stunnel.

## 3. API credentials

Your Go FIX client also requires a few environment variables to sign the FIX Logon. Set the following in your shell before running:

```bash
export ACCESS_KEY="your_api_access_key"
export SIGNING_KEY="your_api_secret_key"
export PASSPHRASE="your_api_passphrase"
export TARGET_COMP_ID="COIN"
export PORTFOLIO_ID="your_portfolio_id"
export SVC_ACCOUNT_ID="your_service_account_id"
```

## 4. Build & Run the Go FIX Client

Run the client:
```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

On successful FIX Logon, you'll see:

```bash
FIX logon SessionID[YOUR_SENDER->COIN]
Commands: new, status, cancel, list, exit
```

## 5. REPL Commands

Once the client is running, type one of the following at the `FIX>` prompt:

### Create a New Order

```bash
FIX> new <symbol> <MARKET|LIMIT> <BUY|SELL> <qty> [price]
```

Example (Limit Buy 0.1 BTC at $30000):

```bash
FIX> new BTC-USD LIMIT BUY 0.1 30000
```

The order is sent, and the ExecReport (fill/cancel information) will be stored in `orders.json`.

### Look Up an Existing Order

```bash
FIX> status <ClOrdId> [OrderId] [Side] [Symbol]
```

This application automatically generates a unique `ClOrdId` (Client Order ID) using `UnixNano`. This value can be collected from `orders.json`, or from FIX responses sent by the server. `OrderId`, `Side`, and `Symbol` are required, however this app will automatically import these to the request based on the provided `ClOrdId`. 

Example:

```bash
FIX> status 1685727281712345678
```
If `orders.json` contains that `ClOrdId`, its `OrderId`, `Side`, and `Symbol` are filled in automatically.

### Cancel an order

```bash
FIX> cancel <ClOrdID>
```

This request looks up an order by `ClOrdId` and attempts to cancel it.

### List All Cached Orders

```bash
FIX> list
```

This command lists out all stored orders from `orders.json`.
